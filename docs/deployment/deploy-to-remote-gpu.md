# Deploy NemoClaw to a Remote GPU Instance

Run NemoClaw on a remote GPU instance through [Brev](https://brev.nvidia.com).
The deploy command provisions the VM, installs dependencies, and connects you to a running sandbox.

## Prerequisites

- The [Brev CLI](https://brev.nvidia.com) installed and authenticated.
- An NVIDIA API key from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com).
- NemoClaw installed locally. Follow the [Quickstart](../get-started/quickstart.md) install steps.

## Deploy the Instance

:::{warning}
The `nemoclaw deploy` command is experimental and may not work as expected.
:::

Create a Brev instance and run the NemoClaw setup:

```console
$ nemoclaw deploy <instance-name>
```

Replace `<instance-name>` with a name for your remote instance, for example `my-gpu-box`.

The deploy script performs the following steps on the VM:

1. Installs Docker and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit if a GPU is present.
2. Installs the OpenShell CLI.
3. Runs the nemoclaw setup to create the gateway, register providers, and launch the sandbox.
4. Starts auxiliary services, such as the Telegram bridge and cloudflared tunnel.

## Connect to the Remote Sandbox

After deployment finishes, the deploy command opens an interactive shell inside the remote sandbox.
To reconnect after closing the session, run the deploy command again:

```console
$ nemoclaw deploy <instance-name>
```

## Remote dashboard access

When you access the dashboard from your laptop via SSH port-forward, set `CHAT_UI_URL` to the URL your browser uses.
This ensures the gateway allows that origin and websocket connections succeed.

The gateway inside the sandbox binds to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) by default so that port-forwarding works.
The sandbox Control UI disables device auth; use the token in the dashboard URL to authenticate.

1. On the remote host, ensure the sandbox is started with the origin you use in the browser.

   ```console
   $ export CHAT_UI_URL="http://YOUR_HOST_IP_OR_NAME:18789"
   ```

2. From your laptop, forward the dashboard port to the remote host.

   ```console
   $ ssh -L 18789:localhost:18789 <instance-name>
   ```

3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` (or the URL shown after sandbox start, including the `#token=...` fragment) in your browser.

To bind the gateway to loopback only (e.g. when not using remote access), set `GATEWAY_BIND=loopback` in the sandbox environment.

## Monitor the Remote Sandbox

SSH to the instance and run the OpenShell TUI to monitor activity and approve network requests:

```console
$ ssh <instance-name> 'cd /home/ubuntu/nemoclaw && set -a && . .env && set +a && openshell term'
```

## Verify Inference

Run a test agent prompt inside the remote sandbox:

```console
$ openclaw agent --agent main --local -m "Hello from the remote sandbox" --session-id test
```

## GPU Configuration

The deploy script uses the `NEMOCLAW_GPU` environment variable to select the GPU type.
The default value is `a2-highgpu-1g:nvidia-tesla-a100:1`.
Set this variable before running `nemoclaw deploy` to use a different GPU configuration:

```console
$ export NEMOCLAW_GPU="a2-highgpu-1g:nvidia-tesla-a100:2"
$ nemoclaw deploy <instance-name>
```
