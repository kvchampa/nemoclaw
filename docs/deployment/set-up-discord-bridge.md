# Set Up the NemoClaw Discord Bridge for Remote Agent Chat

Forward messages between a Discord channel and the OpenClaw agent running inside the sandbox.
The Discord bridge runs on the host because the sandbox proxy does not support the WebSocket connections that the Discord gateway requires.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, confirm that you have the following items in place.

- A running NemoClaw sandbox, either local or remote.
- A Discord application and bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Node.js 20 or later.
- The `discord.js` package installed (`npm install` from the repo root installs it).

## Create a Discord Application and Bot

Create a Discord application and add a bot user to obtain the token the bridge needs.

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select **New Application**.
2. Give the application a name and select **Create**.
3. Go to the **Bot** tab and select **Add Bot**.
4. Under **Token**, select **Reset Token** and copy the token.
   Store it securely.
   Discord does not show it again.
5. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable **Message Content Intent**.
   The bridge requires this intent to read message text.
6. Select **Save Changes**.

## Invite the Bot to Your Server

Generate an invite URL and add the bot to the server where you want it to respond.

1. Go to the **OAuth2 → URL Generator** tab.
2. Under **Scopes**, select `bot`.
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, select **Send Messages** and **Read Message History**.
4. Copy the generated URL, open it in a browser, and select the server you want to add the bot to.

## Set the Environment Variables

Export the bot token and your NVIDIA API key before starting the bridge.
The bridge requires both variables — `nemoclaw start` exits with an error if `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is missing.

```console
$ export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your-bot-token>
$ export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<your-nvidia-api-key>
```

To target a non-default sandbox or model, set the following optional variables before running `nemoclaw start`.

```console
$ export SANDBOX_NAME=<your-sandbox-name>
$ export NEMOCLAW_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b
```

`SANDBOX_NAME` selects which sandbox the bridge connects to. The default is `default`.
`NEMOCLAW_MODEL` sets the model the agent uses for inference. The default is `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`.

## Start Auxiliary Services

Start the Discord bridge and other auxiliary services.

```console
$ nemoclaw start
```

The `start` command launches the following services:

- The Discord bridge forwards messages between Discord channels and the agent.
- The cloudflared tunnel provides external access to the sandbox.

Set the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable before running `nemoclaw start` to enable the Discord bridge.

## Verify the Services

Check that the Discord bridge is running.

```console
$ nemoclaw status
```

The output shows the status of all auxiliary services, including the Discord bridge.

## Send a Message

Open Discord, go to any channel the bot has access to, and send a message.
The bridge forwards the message to the OpenClaw agent inside the sandbox and posts the agent response back to the same channel.

Each channel maintains its own session.
The agent remembers the conversation context within a channel across messages.

## Reset a Session

To clear the conversation history for a channel, send the following message in that channel:

```text
!reset
```

The agent starts a fresh session for the next message in that channel.

## Restrict Access by Guild

To restrict which Discord servers (guilds) can interact with the agent, set the `ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of guild IDs:

```console
$ export ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS="123456789012345678,987654321098765432"
$ nemoclaw start
```

To find a guild ID, open Discord, go to **Settings → Advanced**, enable **Developer Mode**, then right-click the server name and select **Copy Server ID**.

## Stop the Services

To stop the Discord bridge and all other auxiliary services, run the following command.

```console
$ nemoclaw stop
```
